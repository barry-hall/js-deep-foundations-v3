This is a collection of notes and code on the deep js foundations course.

Why? Noone really does much with JS these days. It's often a framework or multiple transpiled layers.

Just because JS might surprise you, it doesn't mean JS is bad or was designed poorly.

Many developers in the JS community with it's low barrier to entry seem to believe that it should be so automatically understandable and that if something isn't intuitive then it was poorly designed. When bitten by something, often they will shift the blame to something else rather than their own understanding.

_Have you read any part of the JS specification?_

This course is about understanding the DNA of JS. To get a deeper understanding and therefore be a better JS developer.
