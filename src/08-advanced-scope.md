# Advanced Scope

## Lexical and Dynamic Scope

**Lexical scope**: The compiler working out scopes ahead of time before being executed. This is the author time decision to put functions and variables in their chosen scope.

Most programming languages are lexically scoped.

**dyanmic scope**: it does exist, most commonly seen in bash script. Bash is not compiled at all.

Lexical scope is popular as you can easily do optimisation. You can create your scopes at design time, you don't have to work them out at runtime.

## Dynamic Scope

If dynamic scoping _did_ exist in JavaScript, it would look like the following; _note this entirely theoretical_.

## Function Scoping


## IIFE Pattern

## Block Scoping

## Choosing let or var

## Explicit let Block

## const

## Hoisting

## Hoisting Example

## let Doesn't Hoist
