# Philosophy of Coercion

## Intentional Coercion

Adopt a coding style that makes your types more obvious. Make your types plain. JavaScript's dynamic typing is not a weakness, it's one of its strong qualities.

## Culture of Learning

Be empathatic in code reviews. Don't be a gate keeper. Don't think junior developers "wont get it". Don't care where you are, care what your direction is. You should use tools well and not be "clever". Your code is a form of communication. There is an effective way to communicate that understands and uses the tool well. Don't let someone get to see you use a "trick" that they never see or use again. Take the time to invest in a way that will help them progress. Tricks might make certain people feel good but they are a waste of someone elses time.

Everyone should be able to interoperate on a codebase. A junior will have to learn some stuff, sure. But you should all be effective at some level.
